# BCI_MotorImagery
Brain-Computer Interface Replication Project
Overview
This project is a foundational exploration into Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology. By leveraging affordable tools like the Muse 2 EEG headset and open-source libraries, the project demonstrates how real EEG signals can be processed to control an interactive game, showcasing the potential of BCI in real-world applications.

Features
Real-Time EEG Signal Processing: Bandpass filtering and threshold calibration for Mu and Beta frequency bands.
Motor Imagery Detection: Translating EEG signals into actionable insights to detect motor imagery.
Interactive Game: A Pygame-based simulation where motor imagery controls a player’s movements in a dynamic environment.
Accessible Codebase: Modular, reusable Python scripts for aspiring BCI researchers.
Objectives
Process real EEG signals from the Muse 2 headset.
Replicate a motor imagery experiment using open-source tools.
Create an interactive game controlled by EEG signals.
Provide a step-by-step guide for beginners in BCI research.
